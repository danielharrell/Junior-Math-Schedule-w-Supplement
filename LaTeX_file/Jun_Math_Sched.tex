{\small \emph{Notes}: Materials needed for Junior Mathematics 
include Galileo's \emph{Two New Sciences}, Newton's \emph{Principia}, and
\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxPc8zGBU1mbrk2H7robq7MhuOLA2Uer/view?usp=sharing}%
{a first semester manual} (which includes the Leibniz essays and notes,
the Dedekind, and the account of Cantor's set theory).  
Many have also found notes on the Newton helpful, even at times necessary.  
The most commonly consulted works include Dana Densmore's \emph{Central Argument},
\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwccG5Ei3816aUtwck5GTUVRWkk/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-cBADjGVmJB56z9dEUeXa1g}{Robert

{Percival Frost's \emph{Principia}}. 
The Section 11 propositions are usually done with
\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0gRZDPmndb5C2JiWYSOIiMQD-mNR2cD/view?usp=sharing}%
{``Two, Three, and Multiple Body Problems''}, written by Chester Burke.
In the more detailed schedule below, there is also occasional mention of
\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PP99RsI_xEZ8rkgXSOlNBS2Wuk_CJkvN/view?usp=sharing}%
{a supplement}, which includes additional documents
that tutors and students may find useful over the course of the year.%
\footnote{A copy of the supplement is also hyperlinked to this schedule. 
If you are reading this version, then the word ``\hyperref[supple.1]{supplement}''
should appear in a different color. Pagination of the supplement appears on the upper-right
corner of each page.}
A more extensive collection of documents was put into
\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZOownvFcTZxxFA6KRutjVLpIjE74503/view?usp=sharing}%
{an online folder} by Michael Dink back in 2016--17.%
\footnote{A zip file of the folder is available at the hyperlink above,
but the folder can also be accessed at the link 
in \href{http://digitalarchives.sjc.edu/faculty}{the digital archives} copy
of Michael's \href{https://digitalarchives.sjc.edu/items/show/2677}{2016--17 archon report}.}

Some tutors have found it useful to consult the tutor-written manual we used for calculus before adopting Leibniz---the so-called \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Eaxua300SdHRIPZwpTj6f9-6sOnjunB/view?usp=sharing}{Kutler manual}.

\label{First}
{\small \emph{Note}: The following schedule 
lists thirty-six assignments for an expected forty-two classes.
Nineteen additional assignments are listed and flagged as optional.

\textbf{\emph{Two New Sciences}} (Galileo)
\vspace{-0.2em}
  \begin{quote}
    \small{\emph{Note}: What follows is only one approach to the Galileo.
    It does not include the so-called ``wheel paradox'' 
    or as much on the phenomenon of motion 
    as older schedules did.  
    For a two-day schedule that includes 
    the wheel paradox, along with a four-day schedule
    that includes more on motion,
    see \hyperref[Galileo]{page \pageref{Galileo}}.
    In another option, one might simply skip the Galileo,
    to allow more time for other first semester readings.
    
    } 
  \end{quote}
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Four excerpts from Aristotle's \emph{Physics}
		(in manual) and NE 77--82 (through ``than
		its division into a thousand
		parts.'').\footnote{Pagination from
			``National Edition'' (NE) found in
			the margins of the Drake-edited
			text.} \item  NE 82--89 (through
		``even after a thousand discussions?'') and
		NE 92--93 (``But it is time now'' through
		``by assuming the said composition of
		indivisibles.'').  \end{enumerate}

{\small \emph{Note}: On older schedules the Galileo was followed by Lemmas 1--11 of the \emph{Principia}, which perhaps makes a better fit with Galileo than Leibniz, especially for classes that spend more time on Galileo. In a more recent order of the past, the Galileo was followed by Leibniz, but Leibniz was followed by Newton. Either order means reading the Dedekind second semester.(See \hyperref[NewtonStart]{page~\pageref{NewtonStart}} for the start of the \emph{Principia} schedule.)

}

\textbf{An Approach to the Arithmetic of Infinites} (Leibniz)
\label{LeibnizInfinites}
\vspace{-0.2em}
\begin{quote}
	\small{\emph{Note}: In the original sequence of Leibniz readings proposed, this paper was read in tandem with a letter Leibniz wrote to Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. See
	\hyperref[supple.86]{page~\pageref{supple.86}} of the
	supplement.}\footnote{The part of the letter relevant to the Leibniz paper begins at the paragraph ``Furthermore, as I go over the rest of your letter\ldots.'' See \hyperref[supple.92]{page~\pageref{supple.92}} of the supplement.}
\end{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
	\item Title, from the first paragraph through the paragraph ending next
		to Note 6. Notes 2--3, 6.\footnote{Notes 1, 4--5 are optional. In the first Leibniz schedule for this reading, the instruction was to have students go to the board to work through the arguments in Notes 2, 3, and 6; and to have students prepare problem 1 in Note 3, and problems 2 and 3 in Note 6.}
	\item From the first paragraph after
		Note 6 to the paragraph ending next to
		Note 7.\footnote{This omits the
			demonstrations of the axioms following the last paragraph read.}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{A New Method} (Leibniz)
\begin{enumerate}[resume*] \item Title and first paragraph.
		Notes 1--3.  \item Second and third
		paragraphs (``Let $a$ be a given constant
		quantity'' through ``find ways to make it
		easier.''). Notes 4--6.  \item Note 7, Part
		3. Omit proofs for negative exponents and
		root rule.\footnote{Doing Part 3 of Note 7
			before Parts 1 and 2 makes
			derivation of the rules prior to
			their application. An alternative
			approach would follow the manual in
			doing Parts 1 and 2 before Part 3.}
	\item Note 7, Part 1, Examples 1--4; Part 2,
		Problems 1--7 odd.  \item Note 7, Part 1,
		Examples 5--7; Part 2, Problems 9--23 odd.
	\item Note 7, Parts 4 and 5.\footnote{Parts 6 and 7
			of Note 7 are omitted, which involve
			the finding of tangents. An
			alternative approach would take a
			day or two to do them.} \item Fourth
		paragraph (``Once we have learned this
		\emph{Algorithm}'' through ``we could find
		it from a given property of the tangents of
		a circle'').  Notes 8--9.\footnote{A tutor-written note on the fourth paragraph can be found on \hyperref[supple.109]{page~\pageref{supple.109}} of the supplement. A copy of the Fermat paper mentioned in footnote 7 on page 33 can be found on \hyperref[supple.112]{page~\pageref{supple.112}} of the supplement.}
\item Last
		sentence of fifth paragraph (``Let me now
		give some easier examples'') through middle
		of sixth paragraph (``things that someone
		skilled in our calculus will henceforth be
		able to produce in three lines''). Notes
		12--19.\footnote{The first example of the
			calculus that Leibniz gives (fifth
			paragraph) is
			skipped.} \item Later in sixth
		paragraph (``As an appendix'') to the end of
		the paper.  Note 22, Parts 1--5.\footnote{An
			example in paragraph six (``I will
			show this with yet another
			example'') is skipped. Also, Parts
			1--5 may be too much for a single
			day. An alternative approach might
			divide this assignment over two
			days: Parts 1--2; 3--5. One might
			also replace Note 22 with a shorter
		tutor-written note, ``De Beaune’s problem to
		Descartes, solved by Leibniz''---see
		\hyperref[supple.14]{page~\pageref{supple.14}}
		of the supplement. On
	\hyperref[supple.20]{page~\pageref{supple.20}} of
	the supplement can also be found ``How to approach an
	exact value for $e$,'' based on Theorem 3 in Part
	3.} \item Note
		22, Part 6.  \end{enumerate}
	 
\textbf{On Recondite Geometry} (Leibniz)
\begin{enumerate}[resume*] \item Title, first three
		sentences of first paragraph (through
		``those who try to prove the impossibility
		of quadrature neglect this distinction'').
		Notes 1--2.  
	\item Fourth and fifth sentences of first paragraph
		(``He recognizes with me that the figures''
		to ``since it supplies the best remedy
		against irrationalities''). Third, fourth,
	       and fifth paragraphs (``Further, to say
	       something more useful here'' to ``thus are
	       not comprehended by means of algebraic
	       equations''). Notes 3--10.\footnote{The rest
		       of the first paragraph and the second
		       paragraph are skipped. A brief
		       elaboration of Note 8 can be found on
		       \hyperref[supple.21]{page~\pageref{supple.21}}
		       of the supplement; and 
	       on
	       \hyperref[supple.22]{page~\pageref{supple.22}},
a fuller treatment of steps in Notes 8 and 9,
	       from an older version of the notes.}
       \item Sixth paragraph (``Furthermore, because hardly
	       anything can be imagined that is more
	       useful'' through ``innumerable other things
	       are also derived from this''). Notes 11--17.	       
       \item Seventh and eighth paragraphs (``Finally, so
	       that I may not seem to ascribe too much to
	       myself'' to ``innumerable transfigurations
	       and equipotencies of figures may arise from
	       this very same thing''). Note
	       18.\footnote{The seventh paragraph might be
		       skipped. And the final paragraph of
		       the paper goes
		       unread.}
       \item Note 19, Parts 1 and 2.\footnote{These parts
		       of Note 19 are sometimes found
		       wanting, especially the
		       formulation and proof of the first
		       fundamental theorem. For a different
		       approach to both theorems, see 
		       \hyperref[supple.28]{page~\pageref{supple.28}}
		       of the supplement.} 
       \item Note 19, Part 3.\footnote{See
		       \hyperref[supple.30]{page~\pageref{supple.30}}
		       of the supplement for an alternative
		       account of algebraic quadratricies,
		       which existed in the manual for two
		       years, is 
		       closer to what is found in calculus
		       textbooks, and is preferred by some
		       tutors.}  
       \item Note 19, Part 4 through Example 4.
       \item Note 19, rest of Part 4.
       \item Note 19, Part 5 through ``Transcendence of the
	       logarithmic line.''
       \item Note 19, rest of Part 5.

{\small \emph{Note}: Given
       time and motivated students, at this point one might

\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
	\item First two sections: ``Functions and

		notation.'' Problem 1 optional. 
	\item Last two sections: ``The method of
		substitution and the chain rule'';
		``Functions of more than one variable and

\ ``Calculus and Newtonian Physics''
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
	\item First paragraph and first two sections:
		``Velocity and force''; ``The phenomenon and

		optional.
	\item Last section: ``Projectile motion''. Problems
		1--4 optional.
\end{enumerate}
{\small \emph{Note}: Given time and interest, at this point one
might read another Leibniz paper (in manual): 
	``On the True Proportion, Expressed
	in Rational Numbers, of a Circle to a Circumscribed
	Square.'' See \hyperref[LeibnizProp]{page
		\pageref{LeibnizProp}} for a
	two-day schedule for this. A one-day alternative is
	to read the defense of his calculus given by Leibniz
	in two letters, or in an early manuscript; see
	\hyperref[supple.46]{page~\pageref{supple.46}} of
	the
supplement for the first and
\hyperref[supple.51]{page~\pageref{supple.51}} for the
second.

\textbf{\emph{Continuity and Irrational Numbers}} (Dedekind)\footnote{Thanks to Andr\'e Barbera, the supplement contains two articles that appeared in \emph{Energeia} in 1965 about Dedekind and Euclid. The first, written by Sam Kutler, can be found on \hyperref[supple.100]{page~\pageref{supple.100}}; the second, by Eva Brann, can be found on \hyperref[supple.102]{page~\pageref{supple.102}}. There is also a longer \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ZP9-NtLSKE-jeJbgjqxgkxo7QWGJVR1/view?usp=sharing}{Kutler essay
on Dedekind}.}
% TODO Mention Kutler article here.
\vspace{-0.2em}
\begin{quote}
\small{\emph{Note}: Another option, found on older schedules, is to read Dedekind second semester, after Newton. This means starting \emph{Principia} first semester, either before or after Leibniz. (The \emph{Principia} schedule begins on \hyperref[NewtonStart]{page~\pageref{NewtonStart}}.)

} 
\end{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
	\item Untitled Preface. Note 1.\footnote{Note 1 is
			long and not directly connected to
		       Dedekind. An alternative approach
	       would delay or even skip this note, and
	       combine this day with the following one. If
       delayed one might read it second semester, after the
first two lemmas of \emph{Principia}. (See
\hyperref[Dedekind]{page~\pageref{Dedekind}} for more on
	this.)}	       
	\item Chapters I--II.
	\item Chapter III. 
	\item Chapter IV: first through beginning of sixth
		paragraph (``Hence the square of every
		rational number $x$ is either $<D$ or
		$>D$''). Note 2 through step (16).
	\item Chapter IV: sixth through ninth paragraph
		(stopping just before paragraph that begins
		``In order to obtain a basis for the orderly
		arrangement of all \emph{real}, i.e., of all
		rational and irrational numbers''). Rest of
	       Note 2.	
       \item Rest of Chapter IV.
       \item Chapter V.
       \item Chapter VI.\footnote{Chapter VII is omitted but
		       could be done with an additional
		       class.}
\end{enumerate}
{\small\emph{Note}: Given time and interest, at this point one
might study Cantor's set theory. Alternatively, this study
might be done second semester, before or after the Newton.
See \hyperref[Cantor]{page~\pageref{Cantor}} for a five-day 
schedule. One way to end the Leibniz-Dedekind-Cantor sequence
is through a brilliant essay by Jos\'e Benardete, \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/14YTO3e3k-1osmcZWnsmN2aEGdqNfefOc/view?usp=sharing}{``Continuity and Theory of Measurement.''}

\begin{quote} \small{\emph{Note}: This
		schedule follows Newton's advice at the
		beginning of Book III, moving straight to
		Book III after Proposition 17 of Book I. But
		a common alternative---and some tutors would
		argue for its importance---is to precede
		Book III with a study of Propositions
		57--69, since 69 is needed for III.7 and
		57--69 form a sequence in itself (section 11
		of Book I). A five-day schedule for this
		sequence can be found on page
		\pageref{Newton}.} \end{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*] \item Preface. Rules.  \item
		Phenomena. Propositions 1 and
		2.\footnote{This schedule gives perhaps the
			most compressed assignment possible
			for the six phenomena that precede
			the propositions in Book III. One
			strategy is refer back to the
			phenomena as they are invoked in the
			proofs for the propositions. But
			older schedules devoted three days
			to the phenomena alone (grouping the
			six in pairs). And a look at
			Densmore's treatment in her
			\emph{Central Argument} (devoting
			nearly fifty pages to them) gives a
			sense of how much one can make of
			the phenomena on their own.}
	\item Propositions 3 and 4. Scholium.\footnote{Proposition 4 would be the focus this day, and arguably deserves a day of its own.}
	\item Proposition 5. Corollaries. Scholium.
	\item Proposition 6. Corollaries.\footnote{On older
			schedules, Propositions 5 and 6 were done
			together, with all the corollaries
			of 5 and Corollaries 1, 2, and 5 of
			6.} 
	\item Proposition 7. 
	\item Propositions 8--13. Hypothesis after
		10.\footnote{A strategy for this assignment
			is to restrict the reading and
			discussion to the enunciations of the
			propositions. Another approach would
		focus on Propositions 8 and 13. Still
		another approach might spend a few days on
		the sequence of propositions in Book I
		(71--76) that lead to III.8, and as if culminating in 8.}
	\item General Scholium after Book III (at end of
		\emph{Principia}).
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{quote}
		{\small \emph{Note}: At this point, given
			time (or even with the
			General Scholium in a single 
			asssignment), one might read an excerpt from
		Newton's \emph{Optics} (Query 31) that bears
	on what he writes in the General Scholium. See
	\hyperref[supple.79]{page~\pageref{supple.79}} of the
