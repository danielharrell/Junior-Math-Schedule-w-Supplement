# Junior Math Schedule with Supplement

Here you can find a PDF of the current schedule for Junior Math 
with a supplement of readings. The idea behind it is to use the
schedule to organize materials otherwise scattered
in files and archon reports.

Any changes I've made to the document are tracked below, 
under the heading [Edits](#edits).

## Instructions

Just click on `LaTeX_file` above, to open that folder;
then on `Jun_Math_Sched.pdf`.
(Alternatively, click on [this link](https://github.com/danielharrell/Junior_Math_Schedule_with_Supplement/blob/7a5f1d4a190b844a5b348a8f43c6cadba822796b/LaTeX_file/Jun_Math_Sched.pdf).)
This should open the file in your browser window. From
there, you can click on
the **Download** button to download the file.

I have also provided the plain text file that generated the PDF
for anyone interested in looking at it. Just click on `Jun_Math_Sched.tex` inside `LaTeX_file` above. (Alternatively, click on [this link](https://github.com/danielharrell/Junior_Math_Schedule_with_Supplement/tree/main/LaTeX_file).)
