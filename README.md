# Junior Math Schedule with Supplement

Here you can find a PDF of the current schedule for Junior Math 
with a supplement of readings. Just click on `Jun_Math_Sched.pdf`
above. This should open the file in your browser window. From
there, you can click on
the **Download** button (just above the document on the right) to download the file, 
if you like.

I have also provided the plain text file that generated the PDF
for anyone interested in looking at it. Just click on the folder
`LaTeX_file`. This should open the folder in your browser window. Then
you can click on `Jun_Math_Sched.tex` to look at the file.

Any changes I've made to the document are tracked just below, 
under the heading **Edits**.
