# Junior Math Schedule with Supplement

Here is a PDF (`Jun_Math_Sched.pdf`) of the current schedule for Junior Math, 
with a supplement of readings.

Changes to the document appear below (under the heading **Edits**). 

I have also provided the plaintext file that generated the PDF (click on the folder `LaTeX_file`)
for anyone interested in it.

## Edits
- Added pagination to supplement.
- Redirected relevant links in schedule to 2021 manual.
- Added "An Approach to the Arithmetic of Infinites" to regular schedule,
at the beginning of the Leibniz sequence.
